  <p>&amp;Hello my name is Divine Jayne Cuevas, but you can call me DJ</p>
  <p>I am a 4th year ungrad at IIT, majoring in Information Technology and Management</p>
  <p>A fun fact about me: I actually love making websites. 
		I started out with CodePen when I was in high school, and that’s when I discovered my passion for web development. 
		It’s a great way for me to showcase my creativity, especially since I also enjoy drawing and using my imagination
